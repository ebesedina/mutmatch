\title{Load and Filter RmdGenesSimilarity Data}
\usage{
.load_and_filter_RmdGenesSimilarity(outlierNeighborsThreshold)
}
\arguments{
\item{outlierNeighborsThreshold}{A numeric value used as the threshold for
filtering the \code{logOR} column in the data. The absolute value of
the \code{logOR} should be less than or equal to this threshold.}
}
\value{
A combined and filtered data.table object.
}
\description{
This function loads chunks of RmdGenesSimilarity data from RDA files,
combines them, and then filters the combined data based on an
outlierNeighborsThreshold value.
}
\details{
This function uses \code{data.table::fread()} to read compressed files. \code{fread()}
requires the \code{R.utils} package to handle \code{.gz} files, which is why \code{R.utils}
is listed as a dependency in this package.
}
\examples{
# Example usage (assuming the function and RDA files exist)
\dontrun{
result_data <- .load_and_filter_RmdGenesSimilarity(0.25)
}
}
